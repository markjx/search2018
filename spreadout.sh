#!/bin/bash

# This shell script takes a directory full of files and
# spreads them out over various output directories.
# They output directories are balanced by file size.
# So, each output directory should take approximately
# the same amount of disk space.
# 
# Sample use cases:
# 1. You've got a bunch of files and you need to split them across file systems
# 2. You've got a tool that processes a directory full of files. You want to 
#    run multiple simultaneous copies of that tool to make your job run faster.
#    So, split your input files across multiple directories! 
#
# $1 is the source folder
# $2...$whatever are the destation folders
#
# version 0.2
